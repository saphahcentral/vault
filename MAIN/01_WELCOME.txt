Welcome to the Obsidian Codex.

This library is a structured collection of research, historical models, geographic correlations, and alternative frameworks that explore humanity’s ancient past and possible future trajectories.

The Codex is organized in layers.

OC0 (MAIN) – Entry level overview and orientation.
OC1 – Restructured African Exodus I.
OC2 – Restructured African Exodus II.
OC3 – Advanced research and extended frameworks.

You are currently in OC0.

This level introduces the concepts without requiring prior belief, background knowledge, or commitment.

Read slowly. Think independently. Compare with your own research.
