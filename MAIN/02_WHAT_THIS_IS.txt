The Obsidian Codex is a research framework.

It is not a religion.
It is not a doctrine.
It is not a replacement for Scripture, science, or history.

It is a synthesis model.

The Codex explores:
– Biblical geography
– African historical correlations
– Migration patterns
– Ancient civilizations
– Geological and environmental events
– Timeline reconstruction

Everything presented is a working model, not a final claim.

The reader is encouraged to test, question, and verify.
