The Codex uses layered timeline analysis.

Instead of assuming a single continuous narrative, the model compares:

– Biblical chronology
– Archaeological periods
– Climate shifts
– Ice age cycles
– Sea level changes
– Volcanic and tectonic events

Where timelines overlap, correlation is explored.
Where they conflict, the discrepancy is noted.
