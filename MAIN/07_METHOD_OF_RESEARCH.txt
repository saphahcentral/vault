Research within the Codex follows four principles:

1. Geographic feasibility
   Distances, terrain, water access, and travel time are evaluated.

2. Environmental realism
   Climate, vegetation, and survival conditions are considered.

3. Cultural continuity
   Language, settlement patterns, and oral traditions are examined.

4. Pattern convergence
   When multiple independent indicators align, the model gains strength.
