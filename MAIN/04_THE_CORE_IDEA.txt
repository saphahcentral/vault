The central question behind the Codex is simple:

What if key events described in ancient texts took place in different geographic locations than commonly assumed?

The African Exodus framework explores the possibility that:

– Major Biblical events occurred in Africa
– Traditional Middle Eastern placements may represent later historical shifts
– Migration and cultural transfer reshaped the historical record

This idea is explored through geography, distance analysis, climate patterns, and settlement logic.
