The African model examines Southern and Central Africa as a possible stage for early Biblical history.

The framework studies:
– River systems
– Mountain regions
– Climate zones
– Migration routes
– Archaeological patterns

The goal is not to replace established history, but to test whether African geography provides stronger logistical or environmental alignment with certain ancient narratives.
