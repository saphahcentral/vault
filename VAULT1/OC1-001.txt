OBSIDIAN CODEX
OC1-001

FOUNDATIONAL STATEMENT

OC1 marks the beginning of formal reconstruction analysis within the Obsidian Codex.

Unlike the introductory layer, this document set moves from conceptual questioning to structured examination. The objective is not to replace established history, but to test whether alternative geographic and migratory frameworks produce stronger explanatory alignment.

This level introduces the Core Relocation Hypothesis:

That certain ancient narratives may be geographically misassigned due to later political, cultural, and institutional consolidation.

The working model does not assume error. It tests probability.

OC1 focuses on:
– Geographic feasibility
– Environmental continuity
– Tribal distribution logic
– Migration patterns
– Structural consistency between text and terrain

Every section in OC1 is constructed as an investigative document, not a declarative claim.

The reader is expected to evaluate each element independently.
