PRE-CATASTROPHE CIVILIZATION INDICATORS

Narratives describing organized societies imply structural complexity.

Legal codes suggest administrative literacy.
Urban centers imply engineering capacity.
Monumental architecture implies labor coordination and surplus production.

If such a civilization existed, its physical environment must show signs of sustained organization prior to disruption.

OC1 examines regions for early indicators of complexity:

– Stone foundations or large-scale earthworks.
– Evidence of irrigation or water redirection.
– Metallurgical residue or slag deposits.
– Standardized construction techniques.
– Burial stratification indicating social hierarchy.

Advanced organization also implies trade. Trade implies transport corridors. Transport corridors imply connectivity between settlements.

Where candidate regions display early complexity followed by abrupt abandonment layers, correlation potential increases.

The absence of any organized infrastructure in a proposed region weakens alignment with narratives describing developed societies.

Catastrophic interruption should leave physical trace. Sediment layers, burn strata, sudden depopulation markers, or agricultural collapse zones must be identifiable.

OC1 does not assume the survival of all evidence. Erosion, climate, and later occupation can obscure early layers.

However, absence of any convergence across independent indicators reduces plausibility.

Civilization leaves imprint.

Even in ruin, pattern remains.
