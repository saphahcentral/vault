CONVERGENCE PRINCIPLE

No single indicator determines validity.

Geography alone is insufficient.
Archaeology alone is insufficient.
Language alone is insufficient.

But when independent indicators converge, structural strength increases.

OC1 operates under convergence logic.

A credible model demonstrates:

– Geographic feasibility.
– Environmental consistency.
– Migration layering.
– Linguistic continuity.
– Strategic alignment.
– Chronological stability.

The greater the number of independent converging indicators, the stronger the model.

Convergence reduces reliance on interpretation and increases reliance on pattern.

Probability rises when independent data sets point in the same direction.
