ENVIRONMENTAL CONSISTENCY

Environmental references within narratives are measurable.

Descriptions of fertile valleys, seasonal flooding, drought cycles, and locust invasions correspond to specific ecological conditions.

A geographic model must support the environmental details embedded within the text.

For example:

A region described as agriculturally abundant must possess predictable rainfall or flood irrigation capacity.

A region described as prone to famine must exhibit climatic variability.

A narrative referencing river overflow implies a river system with measurable seasonal rise.

OC1 cross-references environmental descriptions with climatological data, river basin behavior, and soil fertility studies.

Environmental realism is critical because it constrains exaggeration. Hyperbole rarely sustains multi-generational settlement.

Where the environment naturally produces the conditions described, confidence increases.

Where repeated exceptions must be invoked to explain inconsistency, model stability decreases.

The environment is the silent witness.

It preserves patterns long after political memory fades.
