LINGUISTIC AND ORAL MEMORY CORRELATION

Language preserves migration memory.

Root structures, recurring phonetics, and preserved tribal identifiers often reveal movement patterns invisible in material remains.

OC1 examines linguistic clustering and naming continuity across candidate regions.

Toponyms frequently survive even after political replacement. River names, mountain names, and tribal designations persist beyond conquest.

Oral traditions add additional layers. Multi-generational memory can preserve directional migration, ancestral homelands, and catastrophic events.

While oral accounts require careful filtering, convergence between oral memory and geographic plausibility strengthens reconstruction models.

If multiple linguistic families converge geographically with structural and environmental alignment, probability increases.

Language drifts gradually.

When abrupt linguistic replacement occurs without transitional blending, discontinuity must be explained.

Linguistic continuity is often the quietest but most durable indicator of movement.
