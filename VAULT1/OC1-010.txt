CHRONOLOGICAL STRESS TEST

Chronology must sustain pressure from multiple directions.

Textual timelines, archaeological dating, and climatic phases must overlap within tolerable variance.

When accepted chronologies compress events unrealistically or require simultaneous contradictory developments, the model requires reassessment.

OC1 applies stress testing by layering:

– Text-based sequences.
– Radiometric dating ranges.
– Paleoclimate data.
– Settlement expansion timelines.

The goal is not absolute precision, but structural coherence.

If events align naturally without excessive compression or unexplained gaps, stability increases.

If alignment requires repeated chronological adjustment, reinterpretation may be necessary.

Time either supports the structure or exposes fracture.
