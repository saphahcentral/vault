DEFENSIVE AND STRATEGIC GEOGRAPHY

Pre-modern settlements were survival structures.

Cities were rarely placed without regard for defense. Elevated terrain, natural chokepoints, and proximity to water were decisive factors.

Narratives describing fortified cities, watchtowers, or strongholds imply terrain capable of supporting such defensive infrastructure.

OC1 evaluates whether described urban centers align with:

– Elevated plateaus or ridges.
– Natural barriers such as cliffs or river bends.
– Visibility over trade corridors.
– Access to retreat routes.

If a location lacks defensive logic, the narrative placement weakens.

Strategic positioning also affects political cohesion. Central highland regions often become governance centers due to defensibility and oversight.

Peripheral lowlands tend to serve as agricultural or trade extensions.

A credible geographic model must reflect this hierarchy.

Defense is not symbolic. It is practical.

Where topography aligns with described fortification patterns, plausibility increases.
