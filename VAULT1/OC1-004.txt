MIGRATION SEQUENCE ANALYSIS

Migration is rarely a single event. It is a sequence.

Large population movements unfold in stages:

Departure from origin.

Transitional encampment or staging.

Partial settlement.

Expansion or consolidation.

Each phase leaves archaeological, linguistic, and cultural traces.

A viable reconstruction must demonstrate continuity across these phases. Sudden appearance of a fully formed culture without transitional layering introduces instability in the model.

OC1 evaluates migration feasibility by examining settlement stratigraphy. Entry regions should show early occupation layers followed by expansion zones radiating outward. Trade artifacts, burial practices, and settlement construction methods often reveal directional movement.

Linguistic drift provides additional evidence. Dialects closest to the origin region typically preserve older phonetic structures, while peripheral groups display simplified or blended forms.

A credible migration model must demonstrate:

– Directional consistency.
– Chronological layering.
– Cultural continuity without abrupt replacement.
– Environmental adaptation across terrain shifts.

Where migration requires implausible leaps across inhospitable regions without transitional evidence, structural reliability decreases.

Migration is governed by survival logic. People move toward water, arable land, and defensible terrain. They avoid unnecessary exposure to hostile environments unless compelled by catastrophe.

OC1 measures proposed migration routes against these survival principles.

A movement sequence that aligns naturally with river valleys, pasture corridors, and seasonal rainfall patterns strengthens plausibility.

One that contradicts them requires reconsideration.
