CATASTROPHIC EVENT ALIGNMENT

Large-scale disruption leaves measurable imprint.

Flood deposits, burn layers, sudden abandonment zones, and climatic shifts create geological signatures.

If narratives describe catastrophe, the region must preserve corresponding evidence.

OC1 analyzes candidate areas for:

– Alluvial sediment beyond normal flood cycles.
– Charred occupation layers.
– Rapid cultural displacement.
– Agricultural interruption patterns.

Catastrophe alignment requires both narrative timing and geological trace.

When stratigraphy shows abrupt interruption coinciding with reconstructed chronology, structural alignment strengthens.

Absence of disruption markers does not immediately disprove a model, but repeated absence across multiple indicators reduces confidence.

Catastrophic memory is persistent in cultural tradition.

Geology either confirms or challenges that memory.
