GEOGRAPHIC FEASIBILITY MODEL

All historical reconstruction begins with constraint.

Populations do not move symbolically.
They move through terrain.

Distance limits movement.
Climate limits survival.
Water determines settlement.
Food determines permanence.
Topography determines defense.

If a narrative describes sustained migration, prolonged settlement, or territorial control, those activities must be physically possible within the environmental conditions of the proposed region.

The Geographic Feasibility Model used in OC1 evaluates historical descriptions against real-world physical constraints. The purpose is not to reinterpret narrative meaning, but to test whether the environment can sustain the events described.

The model evaluates five primary factors:

Distance Capacity
Pre-industrial populations traveled at limited speeds. Movement of large groups, including livestock and supplies, rarely exceeded sustainable daily ranges. Extended migrations required staging areas, seasonal pauses, and access to water and forage. When a narrative implies repeated movement between locations, the distances must fall within realistic travel capability.

Terrain Constraint
Mountain systems, dense forest, desert zones, and marshland significantly alter movement speed and survivability. Routes tend to follow river corridors, valleys, coastal plains, or established passes. If a proposed geographic model requires repeated large-scale movement through severe terrain without support routes, feasibility decreases.

Water Dependence
Permanent settlement requires reliable water sources. Seasonal streams are insufficient for long-term population stability. Regions described as supporting large populations, agriculture, or extended encampments must demonstrate consistent river systems, aquifers, or rainfall patterns sufficient for sustained habitation.

Agricultural Viability
Narratives describing settled life, harvest cycles, famine, or surplus imply established agricultural zones. Soil quality, rainfall distribution, flood cycles, and growing seasons must support the population density implied by the text. Regions lacking agricultural capacity cannot support long-term occupation without external supply systems.

Seasonal Stability
Climate extremes affect migration timing and settlement survival. Regions with extreme seasonal heat, cold, or drought require adaptive patterns that should be reflected in the narrative. When environmental seasonality contradicts described living patterns, geographic placement must be reconsidered.

The strength of a geographic model increases when environmental conditions naturally produce the behaviors described in the narrative. If seasonal flooding is described, the region must flood. If pasture migration is described, the region must support grazing cycles. If famine is recorded, the climate must periodically produce agricultural failure.

The model rejects symbolic accommodation. It does not assume that descriptions are metaphorical when environmental evidence is absent. Instead, it tests whether the environment itself can account for the narrative without adjustment.

Where geography supports the account without modification, plausibility increases.

Where geography requires repeated exception, reinterpretation, or symbolic explanation, structural confidence decreases.

The purpose of OC1 is not to assign final locations.
It is to determine which environments can carry the weight of the historical record without strain.

Geography does not argue.
It either supports the narrative, or it does not.
